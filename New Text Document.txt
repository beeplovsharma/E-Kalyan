Subject: Urgent Request to Re-open Scholarship Registration for NIT Jamshedpur

Dear Sir,

I am a student at NIT Jamshedpur, and it has come to our attention that our college had missed the scholarship registration deadline on your website.

We kindly request the reopening of the registration portal for NIT Jamshedpur to allow us to apply for the scholarships. This extension would greatly benefit deserving students who may have missed the deadline.

Your prompt attention to this matter would be highly appreciated.

Thank you.

Best regards,
